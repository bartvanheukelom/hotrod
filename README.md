A game engine where both the engine and the games it runs are:
- largely written in Javascript, or a language that compiles to it, like TypeScript.
- C++ is used to access platform features (such as OpenGL) or do number crunching (such as Bullet Physics).
The Javascript is executed using the V8 runtime.
